# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the selected services component of claims-app (A medical/health App)

**Thoughts:** Still getting used to working with styled components but i think am getting the hang of it. CSS is low key one of the hardest parts of front-end

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
